# CI local plugin

This local_ci plugin contains all the scripts needed
by Moodle CI servers to automate checks while
integration happens.

## Dependencies

+ Some checks require a MySQL, master-based site to be up and running.
+ Some checks require the installation of 3rd part tools (phpunit...).
+ Some checks require the presence of both local_codechecker and local_moodlecheck local plugins.

## TODO

+ Complete the documentation.
+ Document each check properly.

## Self-versions
